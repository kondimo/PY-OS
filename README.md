# PY-OS
PY-OS is a fully open-source python based OS that runs in the computer's command line.
Disclaimer: As the OS is in the Alpha stages, there art some bugs.
When making a new user in the os, the PIN can only be set using numbers.
If the password is forgotten there is no way to retreat it.
Other Info: The `ascii.py` file is a custom library that adds ascii art to the OS.
